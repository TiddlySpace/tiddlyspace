Welcome to your brand new [[TiddlySpace|http://docs.tiddlyspace.com/TiddlySpace]].

You're almost ready to go, there are just a couple of things left to do.

!Customise your space
Go to [[SpaceSettings]] to finish customising  your space. When you're done, come back here (just scroll up). Don't worry though, this will still be open when you've finished.

!Further Customisation

The [[ServerSettings]] tiddler is used to provide the following space configuration options:

#index: The value is the name of a tiddler that will be presented when loading the space.  For example, when set to Hello for the space hello.tiddlyspace.com, navigating to that URL will present the Hello tiddler.
#editor: The name of an [[editor application|http://docs.tiddlyspace.com/Example%20Tiddler%20Editors]] to edit tiddlers with.  Applications are [[included spaces|http://docs.tiddlyspace.com/How%20do%20I%20include%2Fexclude%20spaces%3F]]

To edit these options, click [[here|ServerSettings]] to open the [[ServerSettings]] tiddler then click on the edit button (the pencil icon).  Then add the options you wish to set and then click on the save button (the tick icon).

An example [[ServerSettings]] tiddler:
{{{
index: HelloThere
editor: /edit#{tiddler}
}}}

The additional text after /edit allows a tiddler to be opened in edit mode e.g:
{{{http://hello.tiddlyspace.com/edit#MyTiddler}}}
