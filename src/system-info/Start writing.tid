Click the "new tiddler" button towards the top right of the screen to write something in your space. You'll need to give it a title, some content and, optionally, some tags that will help you identify it later.

!Stuck for ideas?
Not sure what to write about? Not sure what to keep in your space? Other people use ~TiddlySpace for almost anything. How about some of the following:

* [[Save interesting sites|http://bookmarks.tiddlyspace.com]], images or articles from around the web so that you can refer back to them.
* [[Record your family tree|http://familytree.tiddlyspace.com]], store notes on long lost relatives or ancestors and map their relationship to you.
* [[Make up a pocketbook|http://pocketbook.tiddlyspace.com]] to store some useful information in, then print it out, [[fold it up|http://www.pocketmod.com/]], and take it with you.
* [[Plan your holiday|http://the-web-is-your-oyster.tiddlyspace.com/]], record where you're planning to go, note down places of interest and refer back to it later.
* [[Create a mindmap|http://mindmaps.tiddlyspace.com/]] to visualise your inner thoughts and see how they relate to each other.
* [[Set up a questionnaire|http://questionnaire.tiddlyspace.com/]] and get all your friends to answer it.

If you don't like any of those ideas, you can still use this space directly to keep notes and link them together, make a todo list and keep track of everything you're doing, or any one of a hundred million other things.
