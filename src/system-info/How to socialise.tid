There are a lot of interesting people using ~TiddlySpace that you might like to keep track of and interact with. There are two main ways of doing this.

Firstly, if you see a number in the speech bubble in one of your tiddlers, it means that someone is writing about the same thing as you. You can find out what they're saying by clicking on it.

Secondly, if you find anyone interesting, or you find an interesting looking space and you'd like to know when it's changed, you can "follow" that space. To do this, simply create a tiddler with the title: {{{@space-name}}} and tag it {{{follow}}}. If you want, you can store some notes about that space in the body of the tiddler.

If you then want to know what happening, simply [[include|How do I include/exclude spaces?]]@docs the @tivity space and then visit your activity stream at [[/activity|/activity]], or just visit the @tapas space directly.

!Not sure who to follow?
Here's a few suggestions:
* @fnd
* @cdent
* @pmario
* @bengillies
* @dickon
