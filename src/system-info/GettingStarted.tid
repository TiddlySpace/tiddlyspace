Welcome to your brand new [[TiddlySpace]]@glossary.

To get started with this blank [[TiddlySpace]]@glossary, you'll need to modify the following [[tiddlers|Tiddler]]@glossary:
* If you don't like the color scheme click <<RandomColorPaletteButton>> to generate a new random color scheme.
* Upload a [[SiteIcon|SiteIcon tiddler]]@glossary. [[Your SiteIcon|SiteIcon]] gives your space an identity to make it recognisable to others. A good site icon will be square and at least 48*48 pixels size.
<<binaryUploadPublic title:SiteIcon>>
* [[SiteTitle]] & [[SiteSubtitle]]: The title and subtitle of the site, as shown above (after saving, they will also appear in the browser title bar)
* [[MainMenu]]: The menu (usually on the left)
* [[DefaultTiddlers]]: Contains the names of the tiddlers that you want to appear when the ~TiddlySpace is opened
* Many features of ~TiddlySpace are accessed via the backstage bar located at the top of the page. You can toggle it on or off using the button in the top right corner of the screen.
