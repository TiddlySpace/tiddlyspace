TiddlySpace uses MySQL as its storage. Therefore it requires:

* tiddlywebplugins.mysql
* tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy
* pyparsing
* sqlalchemy
* MySQL-Python

All of which are available from PyPI.

Also required, of course, is MySQL itself. If your operating system
includes its own packaging of mysql, then use that. Otherwise see
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/

Update the global my.cnf to add to the [mysqld] section:

   ft_min_word_len = 3
   ft_stopword_file = ''

This is required for the fulltext index to work correctly.

my.cnf is often in /etc/mysql/my.cnf or /etc/my.cnf

Ensure MySQL's default storage engine is set to MyISAM. You may
need to add the following global to the [mysqld] section of my.cnf:

   default_storage_engine = MYISAM

You will need to create two databases:

* 'tiddlyspace' for the dev instance
* 'tiddlyspacetest' for testing

You will need to grant a user access. Learning how to use msyql is
out of scope for this document. See http://www.mysql.com/ for
documentation, tutorials, etc.

TiddlySpace has a default store configuration of:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.mysql', {
        'db_config': 'mysql:///tiddlyspace?charset=utf8&use_unicode=0'}],
    'indexer': 'tiddlywebplugins.mysql',

which defaults to using whoever the current user is.

On the deployed server this is changed to:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.caching', {}],
    'cached_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.mysql', {
        'db_config': 'mysql://tiddlyweb@localhost/tiddlyspace?charset=utf8&use_unicode=0'}],
    'indexer': 'tiddlywebplugins.mysql',

which uses 'tiddlyweb' as the user.

To enable fulltext indexing for searches without fields (compare:

* /search?q=GettingStarted        <= no field
* /search?q=ftitle:GettingStarted <= field

) once the database is up and running do:

echo "create fulltext index full on revision(tiddler_title, text, tags);" | \
    mysql tiddlyspace
