Sauce Labs Testing
==================

Requires:

* Node
* A Sauce Labs account under TiddlySpace

The QUnit tests can be run against multiple browser types via the Sauce Labs
platform.

This requires a Sauce Labs username and access key.  Once you have these, set
them as environment variables as follows:

    export SAUCE_USERNAME=<username>
    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<key>

For first time setup run:

    make saucelabs_deps

To run tests via Sauce Labs:

    make saucelabs_test

Testing Locally
===============

To run the QUnit tests on a local browser of your choice:

    jstest_browser

Then navigate to:

    http://localhost:9999/test/
