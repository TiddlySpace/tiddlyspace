"""
ControlView is for protecting the pope (PTP).

Jermoelen says:

The PTP issue boiled down to a desire that it should not be possible to
reach tiddler content via a space URI unless that content has been
explicitly stored or included into the space.

The goal was to avoid mischievous people being able to construct URIs
that made it look as though arbitrary content were part of a target
space. Imagine an organisation using the bring your own domain feature
to implement http://mysite.org/ on TiddlySpace. They prepare lots of
content and share it with their community. Then imagine a mischievous
person who wants to make it appear as though http://mysite.org/ were
illegally hosting copyrighted materials. He can upload the material to
his own space, and then, without ControlView, he can construct a URI
that starts with http://mysite.org/ but points to the illegal content.
To a reasonably knowledgeable user, it would look as though the
copyright content were hosted on http://mysite.org/.

The example isn't to suggest that the feature is intended to protect
copyright holders; it's more about protecting groups and individuals
from defamation and fraud.
